# Portfolio Backtesting Toolkit

A collection of tools for backtesting and evaluating portfolio strategies based on expected returns, risk metrics, and user-defined tolerance levels. This project includes modular functions (organized in `Utils.py`) and a practical application (`Chap_7_Testing_Strategies_in_Practice.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to combine these tools for real-world strategy analysis.

## Features
- 📈 Backtest different portfolio strategies
- 📊 Analyze performance based on custom metrics
- ⚙️ Modular utility functions for easy reuse
- 📚 Step-by-step development through 7 chapters
- 🎯 Combine tools into a complete testing framework

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (pyplot)
- yFinance (for financial data)
